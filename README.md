# S3-to-DynamoDB-to-Redshift-Data-Pipeline
This project automates the process of loading data from a CSV file stored in an S3 bucket into DynamoDB using an AWS Lambda function. It subsequently copies the data from DynamoDB to an Amazon Redshift cluster for analysis. Additionally, it demonstrates how to access external data using Redshift Spectrum and unload data back to S3.
